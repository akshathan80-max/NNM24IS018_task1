# NNM24ISO18 – Task 1

## Conclusion
This repository contains my SDLC case study submission for Task 1, including the initial and revised versions of the requirements document and the final report. The work summarizes the selected system requirements and discusses suitable SDLC models (Waterfall, Incremental, Spiral) with diagrams and justification.

## Branching & Merging Strategy
Work was updated in stages and changes are tracked using commits in this repository. If a separate draft/dev branch was used, the final work was merged into `main`; otherwise, updates were committed directly to `main`.
